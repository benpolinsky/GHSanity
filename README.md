# GH Sanity

Tame GitHub notifications.

## Features todo

- all finished PRs mark as done (maybe not issues)
- display issue or pr icon
- checkbox select mass actions
- all filter options/multiple filters
- get latest comment, or even bring up thread in pane to the right... enough to know if you want to click through
- use since header to avoid killing api rate limit (conditional requests)
- think about react strict mode killing api rate limit
- look into webhooks (probably a no-go for org...)
- rate limit component doesn't seem useful, I dunno.
- done vs read
- next app
- add settings screen rather than hard code

### Filters to add

- Custom query
- Label
- finished/closed prs
- closed issues
