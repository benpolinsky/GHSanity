# GH Sanity

Tame GitHub notifications.

## Features todo

- filter by label is inverted, maube select existing and then select exlude.
- checkbox select mass actions
- all finished PRs mark as done (maybe not issues)
- all filter options/multiple filters
- get latest comment, or even bring up thread in pane to the right... enough to know if you want to click through
- use since header to avoid killing api rate limit (conditional requests)
- think about react strict mode killing api rate limit
- rate limit component doesn't seem useful, I dunno.
- done vs read
- add settings screen rather than hard code
- look into webhooks (probably a no-go for org...)
- undo
