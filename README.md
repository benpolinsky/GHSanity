# GH Sanity

Tame GitHub notifications.

## Features todo

- all finished PRs mark as done (maybe not issues)
- display issue or pr icon
- checkbox select mass actions
- all filter options/multiple filters
- get latest comment, or even bring up thread in pane to the right... enough to know if you want to click through
- use since header to avoid killing api rate limit (conditional requests)
- think about react strict mode killing api rate limit
- look into webhooks (probably a no-go for org...)
- rate limit component doesn't seem useful, I dunno.
- done vs read
- next app
- add settings screen rather than hard code

## Design Focus

The application features a clean, modern, and minimalistic dark theme with high-contrast text and subtle accents. The layout is uncluttered with clear typography and straightforward navigation, emphasizing readability and ease of use. Specific font sizes, line-heights, and consistent spacing are used to ensure a cohesive design.
